# 🚀 DSA Practice in Java & Python  

Welcome to Our **DSA-Practice Repository** 🎉  
This is Our personal space where We solve **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems using **Java** and **Python**.  

I created this repo to:  
- Strengthen my **problem-solving skills** 💡  
- Build consistency in **DSA practice** 🧑‍💻  
- Prepare for **coding interviews** and challenges ⚡  
- Compare approaches in **Java vs Python** for deeper understanding 🔀
